    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the relationship between Seaborn and Matplotlib, and when to use each \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore several different kinds of visualizations we can create with Seaborn. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib, so you'll find that it will feel quite familiar. \n",

    "* Import `seaborn` and set the standard alias of `sns`\n",
